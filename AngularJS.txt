AngularJS :-
-	AngularJS is a MVC style JavaScript Framework for creating Single Page Application (SPA) in the projects.
-	Additional content brought into the web page without refresh.
-	AngularJS is open source and licensed under the Apache license version 2.0.
-	It is now maintained by Google. Its latest version is 1.X.


Features :-
-	Data-binding	:	It is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view components.
-	Directives	:	Directives are markers on DOM elements (such as elements, attributes, css, and more). 
					These can be used to create custom HTML tags that serve as new, custom widgets. AngularJS has built-in directives (ngBind, ngModel...)
-	Templates	:	These are the rendered view with information from the controller and model. 
					These can be a single file (like index.html) or multiple views in one page using "partials".
-	Filters		:	These select a subset of items from an array and returns a new array.
-	Dependency Injection	:	AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection subsystem that helps the developer by making the
								application easier to develop, understand, and test.
				
				
Disadvantages of AngularJS :-
-	Not Secure	:	Being JavaScript only framework, application written in AngularJS are not safe. 
					Server side authentication and authorization is must to keep an application secure.
-	Not degradable	:	 If your application user disables JavaScript then user will just see the basic page and nothing more.


Directive :-
-	AngularJS directives are used to extend HTML. 
-	These are special attributes starting with ng- prefix.
1)	ng-app	:	This directive defines and links an AngularJS application to HTML.
				Every thing inside this is angular application.
2)	ng-model:	This directive binds the values of AngularJS application data to HTML input controls.
3)	ng-bind	:	This directive binds the AngularJS Application data to HTML tags.
4)	ng-init :	This directive initializes application data.
5)	ng-repeat : This directive repeats html elements for each item in a collection. (foreach loop)
6)	ng-controller
7)  ng-include : include other page. Ex: <header ng-include="'header.html'"></header>
8)	ng-show ng-hide	:	show hide
9)	ng-click : onclick event fire
10)	ng-submit
11)	ng-src   : image path



Expressions :-
-	Expressions are used to bind application data to html. 
-	Expressions are written inside double braces like {{expression}}. 
-	Expressions behaves in same way as ng-bind directives.
-	AngularJS application expressions are pure javascript expressions and outputs the data where they are used.


Modules :-
-	Modules are used to separate logics say services, controllers, application etc. and keep the code clean. 
-	We define modules in separate js files and name them as per the module.js file.


Controllers :-
-	AngularJS application mainly relies on controllers to control the flow of data in the application. 
-	controller is defined using ng-controller directive. 
-	A controller is a JavaScript object containing attributes/properties and functions. 
-	Each controller accepts $scope as a parameter which refers to the application/module that controller is to control.
